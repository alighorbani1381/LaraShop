# Version of Packages And Version of Laravel very important
For install packages you must read exact documentation of package from GitHub And Selected 
Adapteble Package Version 

Technical Tip :-) -> In My Opinion Use Laravel (6.18) This Version don't Old & don't New It's Good Version For Development (Use Package)

if you use from https://packagist.com read exact
Complied Version of laravel 

How to Give Version of Laravel?
* $ php artisan --version

# Restart Authentication

When you must migrate to upper or  lower version of laravel you must reset authentication and packages but
when you change authentication (Install from new laravel) maybe authentication want to create it thisPage(Login, Register, Dashbord)
and in this pages use @extends('welcome.app') and if you change this file replace auth file and destroy your project file (Replaced)
How To Fixed This Problem?
* You Have Two Ways To Fixed This Problem
* 1)- Laravel if auth file(LayoutFile & Blade File) is existed then commandLine Ask you:
*  The [auth/FileName.blade.php] view already exists. Do you want to replace it? (yes/no) :
*  and you can write Yes or No => and you write (no)
*
* 2)- Next Solution is Change Your LayoutFile Name and don't use This File however you used this file  [Default Layouts File] use First Solution for fixed your problem

# About Give Data (Accessor)
You exact what is type of returned data From Eloquent
when use get()       return Array Object
and when use first() return Object

#Debug Ajax Code (FrontEnd vs BackEnd)

after Setup Ajax and Set XSRF Token for Ajax maybe you has Error but beceause The Request is Ajax you don't See Error
Mabe Error For This
0)- Don't JQuery Embeded (Set Before Your Ajax Code)
1)- Ajax Setup (Laravel XSRF Token)
2)- Ajax Code Has Error (Single Cotation or stuff like This)
3)- Deffrent Type AjaxSend Route (Ajax Send Parammeter with POST vs destination Route Type GET)
4)-Your Code From Server Has Error(Fetal, Parse) 

چکار کنم؟
First you must Check Set your Ajax Setup is OK
and Then go to console broswer For See Errors [0,2] 

وقتی که مطمئن شدی که
This Error Don't Related To The FrontEnd (FileEmbed & AjaxSetup & JsCode)

>> Go To Deubug From ServerSide Code

For Fix Server Code Problem You go to the Ajax code and change ajax's type to get (Like write in url)
And Then Your Route Set to Get Route (When Your Route type was a POST)
Tip: if you use resource route defined Get Route and use it
Now You Can See Error From Server Let's Go To Debug it 
for Debug From Server (Laravel) don't forget dd & die

Accessors (Add Attribute to Elequent)

What is Accessor?
Defining An Accessor
Eloquent provides a convenient way to transform your model attributes when getting or setting them. Simply define a getFooAttribute method on your model to declare an accessor. 
Keep in mind that the methods should follow camel-casing, even though your database columns are snake-case:
/*
class User extends Model {

    public function getFirstNameAttribute($value)
    {
        return ucfirst($value);
    }

}
*/
In the example above, the first_name column has an accessor. Note that the value of the attribute is passed to the accessor.

Why Use Accessor From Laravel?
sometimes We need a run query from data in the foreach such as basket has User_id And Product_id when any basket looping from foreach we run query
like This 
/*
foreach($baskets as $basket){
    $product=getProduct($basket->product_id);
    $user=getProduct($basket->user_id);
}
*/
and this is not a Clean Code !!!
but when you use Accessors you can run many query from any object from model and it's very good to Development
Tip & Experience: when you need a one Object in you Accessor you must return data with Object don't array Object
and for this return with first() method and when use it like this
    $basket->product->name

Learn About JQuery Event Add Content
$(selector).html();     => Change HTML Code (You Can Write HTML In The Tag)
$(selector).text();     => Write a Text From Tag (Like Write Text from P Tag)
$(selector).val();      => Write a Value From Input tag (Many Tag has Value Given)

/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

#Get Current Route Name
Route::current()->getName(); => 'basket.index'
Route::currentRouteName();  =>  'basket.index'

#Bug From Laravel or Packages
Text of Error :=> A non well formed numeric value encountered 
for fixed this problem you  must update symfony var_dumper from conposer
composer update symfony/var-dumper

How to Use  variable from function?
$txt="Hello World!";
public function () use($txt){
    echo $txt;
}

/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

That is A Very  Very  Very  Very important When Your Use resource Route
and after you need increment route to this route for read
you must write new route before resource route
